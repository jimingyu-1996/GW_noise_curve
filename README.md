# GW_noise_curve

The noise curve used in our work. The first and second columns represent the frequency (Hz) and sensitivity (1/sqrt(Hz)) of each detector, respectively. The noise curve of LIGO, ETD, NEWCE are from https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0113/T1400316/004/T1400316-v5.pdf, 2010CQGra..27s4002P and 2017CQGra..34d4001A, respectively.
